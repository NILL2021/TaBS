        <p>TaBS stands for Text Based Scratch (we don't talk about the "a"). It uses JavaScript to implement a simplistic language with each line being an "Instruction Block". Originally, the plan was to make it compile to .sb3, but I decided not to, since
            themain reason I created this was to make more complex projects without having to learn a mainstream language like JavaScript, and instead use one inspired by scratch.This is very unfinished.</p>
